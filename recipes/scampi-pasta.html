    <h2>The Dish!</h2>
        <p>This recipe needed modification from the original because there
            was simply too much Old Bay.</p>

        <p>We recommend no more than 2tbsp of Old Bay per pound of shrimp.</p>

    <h3><em>Ingredients</em></h3>
        <ul>
            <li>12-ounces pasta, spaghetti or linguine</li>
            <li>1 pound raw shrimp, peeled and deveined</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons Old Bay seasoning</li>
            <li>1/4 cup olive oil</li>
            <li>3 garlic cloves, minced (about 1 tablespoon minced)</li>
            <li>1 lemon, juiced (about 2 tablespoons)</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons chopped parsley</li>
            <li>1/2 cup dry white wine</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h3><em>Steps</em></h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Cook pasta according to package directions for al dente. Reserve about 1/4 cup pasta water before draining.</li>
            <li>In a bowl, toss shrimp with Old Bay seasoning until evenly coated.</li>
            <li>Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium high heat.</li>
            <li>Working in batches, saut√© shrimp until no longer pink. Remove from pan and set aside.</li>
            <li>Reduce heat to medium. Add garlic and parsley to the pan and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds.</li>
            <li>Deglaze the pan with white wine and lemon juice.</li>
            <li>Return shrimp to the pan. Reduce heat to low and allow them to simmer in the sauce mixture for a few minutes.</li>
            <li>Add the cooked pasta and reserved water to the pan. Toss with the shrimp and sauce mixture until evenly combined.</li>
        </ol>
